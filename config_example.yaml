author:
  name: "Your Name"
  # Your Semantic Scholar author ID. Find it at:

# ---------- Output ----------------------------------------------------------

output:
  # Where the daily markdown file is written.
  directory: "~/Documents/notes/"
  # Python strftime pattern for the filename.
  filename_pattern: "%Y-%m-%d.md"

# ---------- arXiv categories to search --------------------------------------
#
# Each category block defines:
#   categories  – list of arXiv category codes
#   label       – heading used in the output markdown
#   keywords    – keyword config (two modes available, see below)
#
# KEYWORD FILTERING — two modes:
#
# 1. GROUP-BASED (recommended): organise keywords into topic clusters.
#    A paper must match keywords from ≥ min_groups *distinct* groups.
#    This avoids false positives from co-occurring generic terms
#    (e.g. "black hole" + "horizon" is one group, not two signals).
#
#    keywords:
#      groups:
#        group_name_1: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]
#        group_name_2: [keyword3, keyword4, ...]
#      min_groups: 2
#      exclude_if: [unwanted1, unwanted2]
#
# 2. FLAT-LIST (legacy): high_priority + secondary lists with thresholds.
#
#    keywords:
#      high_priority: [kw1, kw2, ...]
#      secondary: [kw3, kw4, ...]
#      min_high: 2
#      min_high_alt: 1
#      min_secondary: 2
#
# Both modes support:
#   include_if  – if set, paper must match at least one of these to be
#                 considered (useful for niche categories like cs.CY)
#   exclude_if  – skip papers containing any of these strings
#
# TIP: use the --analyze-feedback flag after collecting feedback to see
# which groups/keywords have the best and worst precision, then tune.
